    <h4>Uploading Data</h4>
    <p>Uploading data is simple, all you need to do is send a POST request with content-type <code>application/json</code> to <code>/result</code>.</p>
    <p>Your JSON must respect all the required fields, if not, you will get back a <code>400</code> :)</p>
    <p>Example: <code>curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"name":"Anonymous", "gpu":"GPU DUMMY TEXT","cpu":"CPU DUMMY TEXT","log":"So this will be a detailed log.","score": 1}' http://localhost:5000/result</code></p>
    <p>If the resource has been added sucessfully then the status code of <code>201</code> is returned, any other status code can be considered an error</p>
    <p>The <code>name</code> field can be used with the build in search functionality to search for results.</p>
    <p>The <code>location</code> header can be inspected for an url to the newly created result.</p>
